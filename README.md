# Portfolio Website with Next.js & React Three Fiber
This is my portfolio website created with React Three Fiber (R3F) by me 100%. The execution of this project lasted for 5 months and it was a big challenge.

## The technologies
For this project, I've used those dependencies:
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
* [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com)
* [Three.js](https://threejs.org)
* [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction)
* [R3F - Post Processing](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-postprocessing/introduction)
* [R3F - Drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei#readme)

*As well as some other things like GLSL to do the planet's surface.*
